                <p>These take place over 5 weeks – with 1 x 2hr session per week and homework in between. This 5 week puppy pre school course is ideal for puppies aged between 8-16 weeks. Class sizes are small to allow for individual attention. This course is designed to set your puppy up with a basic foundation in learning &amp; training and prevent future problems such as fearfulness, aggression and destructive behaviour. To get the full benefits of the course, practicing at home during the week is vital.</p>
                <p>This class will also assist in socialising your puppy to other dogs, people and new things in a safe and secure environment. This is vital to ensure a well adjusted, calm, happy puppy.</p>
                <p>We run puppy preschools starting the first week of the month. We have sessions on Saturday mornings (9 -11) or Wednesday evenings (6 – 8).</p>
